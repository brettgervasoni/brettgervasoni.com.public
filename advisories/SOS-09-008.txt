Details.
SafeNet SoftRemote is an IPsec VPN client that sets up a secure 
channel for data transport. The application is a popular VPN client
which has been OEM'd by many other companies. As a result this 
vulnerability affects a number of products and vendors. 

SafeNet SoftRemote is vulnerable to a local stack based buffer 
overflow which can lead to the compromise of a vulnerable system. 

The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing
certain sections of spd (policy) files. Passing an overly long
string to either "TREENAME" or "GROUPNAME" will trigger the
overflow. Successful exploitation results in the execution of
arbitrary code. 
 
Solution.
Fixed in 10.8.9 (unverified).
