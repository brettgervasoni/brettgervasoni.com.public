Details.
TheGreenBow is an IPsec VPN client that sets up a secure channel
for data transport.

TheGreenBow VPN Client is vulnerable to a local stack based buffer
overflow, which can lead to the compromise of a vulnerable system.
 
The vulnerability is caused due to a boundary error when processing
certain sections of tgb (policy) files. Passing an overly long 
string to "OpenScriptAfterUp" will trigger the overflow. 

Successful exploitation results in the execution of arbitrary code.

Solution.
A patch is available from the vendor and will be included in the
next release. 

The patch can be downloaded from:
