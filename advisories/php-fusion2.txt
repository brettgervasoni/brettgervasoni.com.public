 Details
Vulnerable Systems:
 * PHP-Fusion version 4.01 and prior

The SQL injection is possible due to improper validation of the 'rowstart' parameter passed to the index.php script. A simple example is suffice to demonstrate the behavior:
index.php?rowstart='

As simple a vulnerability as this is, it is a very dangerous vulnerability when a malicious user is able to alter the original SQL queries and manipulate the backend database server.
